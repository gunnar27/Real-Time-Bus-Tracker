Title of the project: Real Time Bus Tracker

Description of the project: This project displays bus marks on a map of Boston using Google Maps. The project makes calls to Bostons MBTA public data feed every 15 seconds to show where the correlated 'red' and 'blue' line buses are on their pathways. 

How to Run: You will need to create your own Google Maps key. Download all files and run them in your local environment!

Roadmap of future improvements: In the future, I would like to add further functionality to show other modes of transportation.
